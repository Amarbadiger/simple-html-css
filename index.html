    <h1><u>   Cyber Security___</u></h1>
    <img src="./img/hack2.jpg" alt="" width="1000px" height="400px" class="hackimg" />
    <p>Cyber security refers to every aspect of protecting an organization and its employees and assets against cyber
      threats. As cyberattacks become more common and sophisticated and corporate networks grow more complex, a variety
      of cyber security solutions are required to mitigate corporate cyber risk.</p>
      <h2>The Different Types of Cybersecurity</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Network Security

        Most attacks occur over the network, and network security solutions are designed to identify and block these
        attacks. These solutions include data and access controls such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP), IAM (Identity
        Access Management), NAC (Network Access Control), and NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall) application controls to
        enforce safe web use policies.

        Advanced and multi-layered network threat prevention technologies include IPS (Intrusion Prevention System),
        NGAV (Next-Gen Antivirus), Sandboxing, and CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction). Also important are network
        analytics, threat hunting, and automated SOAR (Security Orchestration and Response) technologies.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Cloud Security

        As organizations increasingly adopt cloud computing, securing the cloud becomes a major priority. A cloud
        security strategy includes cyber security solutions, controls, policies, and services that help to protect an
        organization’s entire cloud deployment (applications, data, infrastructure, etc.) against attack.

        While many cloud providers offer security solutions, these are often inadequate to the task of achieving
        enterprise-grade security in the cloud. Supplementary third-party solutions are necessary to protect against
        data breaches and targeted attacks in cloud environments.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Endpoint Security

        The zero-trust security model prescribes creating micro-segments around data wherever it may be. One way to do
        that with a mobile workforce is using endpoint security. With endpoint security, companies can secure end-user
        devices such as desktops and laptops with data and network security controls, advanced threat prevention such as
        anti-phishing and anti-ransomware, and technologies that provide forensics such as endpoint detection and
        response (EDR) solutions.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Mobile Security

        Often overlooked, mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones have access to corporate data, exposing
        businesses to threats from malicious apps, zero-day, phishing, and IM (Instant Messaging) attacks. Mobile
        security prevents these attacks and secures the operating systems and devices from rooting and jailbreaking.
        When included with an MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution, this enables enterprises to ensure only compliant
        mobile devices have access to corporate assets.</li>
        <br>
      <li>IoT Security

        While using Internet of Things (IoT) devices certainly delivers productivity benefits, it also exposes
        organizations to new cyber threats. Threat actors seek out vulnerable devices inadvertently connected to the
        Internet for nefarious uses such as a pathway into a corporate network or for another bot in a global bot
        network.

        IoT security protects these devices with discovery and classification of the connected devices,
        auto-segmentation to control network activities, and using IPS as a virtual patch to prevent exploits against
        vulnerable IoT devices. In some cases, the firmware of the device can also be augmented with small agents to
        prevent exploits and runtime attacks.</li>
        <br>
      <li>Application Security

        Web applications, like anything else directly connected to the Internet, are targets for threat actors. Since
        2007, OWASP has tracked the top 10 threats to critical web application security flaws such as injection, broken
        authentication, misconfiguration, and cross-site scripting to name a few.

        With application security, the OWASP Top 10 attacks can be stopped. Application security also prevents bot
        attacks and stops any malicious interaction with applications and APIs. With continuous learning, apps will
        remain protected even as DevOps releases new content.</li>
        <br>
      <li> Zero Trust

        The traditional security model is perimeter-focused, building walls around an organization’s valuable assets
        like a castle. However, this approach has several issues, such as the potential for insider threats and the
        rapid dissolution of the network perimeter.

        As corporate assets move off-premises as part of cloud adoption and remote work, a new approach to security is
        needed. Zero trust takes a more granular approach to security, protecting individual resources through a
        combination of micro-segmentation, monitoring, and enforcement of role-based access controls.</li>
